# petSOS
Inspiration
The primary inspiration behind the app is to provide a platform for pet owners who have lost their beloved pets. It aims to leverage the power of community and real-time updates to increase the chances of finding missing pets. By enabling users to post real-time alerts and display them on an interactive map, the app facilitates quick and widespread dissemination of information, increasing the likelihood of finding lost pets. In the meantime, our app PetSOS seeks to create a sense of community among pet owners and animal lovers. It encourages users to come together, support each other, and actively participate in the search for missing pets. By notifying people in the vicinity of a missing pet, PetSOS promotes local engagement and collaboration, fostering a collective effort to reunite pets with their owners.

What it does
Pet SOS is a mobile app designed to assist pet owners in finding their missing pets and also give people who found stray pets a chance to send them home. With real-time functionality, users can post alerts about their lost pets, which are then displayed on an interactive map within the app. The map allows users living in the vicinity to receive immediate notifications, increasing the chances of locating the missing pet. The app also offers a discovery feature, enabling users to explore and engage with posts from others in their area, fostering community support. Pet SOS harnesses the power of location-based technology and a compassionate network of pet lovers to facilitate the swift and collective effort of reuniting pets with their owners.

How we built it
We designed the screens which our application would include and created transitions and responsibilities for each of the screens. Then we assigned each member a screen that we work on and finally assemble the whole application.

Challenges we ran into
Our team has two newbies that are new to Hackathons. Despite it being their first time, they are very hard-working and learned so much in just two days. Besides this, we managed to solve a lot of problems like dealing with the Expo install issue and solving merge conflicts.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Team management and work distribution were extremely organized during this hackathon. Every team member gets to show their unique talent in different stages of the software development process. More importantly, we managed to deliver the finished product with decent quality.

What we learned
Developing an app from scratch within a limited timeframe presented various challenges. We developed problem-solving skills and the ability to think creatively to overcome obstacles and find innovative solutions.

What's next for petSOS
In the next steps, we will focus on the following aspects to improve our product:
1.Fully implement some features that were hard coded due to lack of time to complete.
2.External System Integration: We want to focus on working with existing databases to store and retrieve data for the posts.
3.User Privacy: We understand our app will have to get access of user's locations and other privacies. However, we will continue to work on user privacy to guarantee privacies stay private. We would further ensure that user data, including personal information and location data, is securely stored on servers or databases. Implement encryption and proper access controls to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
